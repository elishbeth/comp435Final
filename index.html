            <h1>Motivation</h1>
            <p>Food deserts are locations in urban areas where there is low access to quality food. This can mean that grocery stores are far away, or that the stores that are close do not provide affordable fresh food. According to the US Department of Agriculture, there are “as many as 30 million adults and 12 million children living in a household where they may not always get enough to eat.” We want to investigate where local food deserts are and who lives in those areas, and if there are other factors that are related such as redlining, or interest rates.</p>
